This project implements a simple BASIC-like programming language interpreter in Java. It supports fundamental programming constructs and provides the ability to execute simple algorithms(for now, mathematical expressions). The interpreter includes functionality for tokenizing input, parsing it into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and evaluating the result. It serves as an educational project to explore the basics of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation.


## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus.
- **Variable Assignment**: Using `LET` for setting variable values.
- **Input/Output**: Use `INPUT` for user input and `PRINT` for outputs.
- **Control Flow**:
  - Support for basic loops and conditionals.
- **Algorithm Implementations**:
  - Sum of First N Numbers
  - Factorial of N
  - GCD of Two Numbers
  - Reverse a Number
  - Check if a Number is Prime
  - Check if a Number is Palindrome
  - Find the Largest Digit in a Number
