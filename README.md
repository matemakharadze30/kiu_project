# Tato Chumburidze
Role: Lexer Developer and Documentation Specialist
Responsibilities:
Designing and implementing the lexer for tokenizing input strings into meaningful components (e.g., numbers, operators, and keywords).
Ensuring accurate tokenization for various edge cases.
Writing and maintaining project documentation, including the README.md and inline code comments.
Tracking progress and task assignments via GitHub Issues and Discussions.
# Mate Makharadze
Role: Lead Developer and Parser Specialist
Responsibilities:
Designing and implementing the parser to convert tokens into a structured abstract syntax tree (AST).
Ensuring proper syntax validation and efficient parsing logic.
Assisting with overall architecture and integration of the interpreter components.
Reviewing pull requests and maintaining code quality across the project.

# Desc.
This project implements a simple BASIC-like programming language interpreter in Java. It supports fundamental programming constructs and provides the ability to execute simple algorithms(for now, mathematical expressions). The interpreter includes functionality for tokenizing input, parsing it into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and evaluating the result. It serves as an educational project to explore the basics of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation.
